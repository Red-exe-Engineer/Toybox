# Toybox

Info:

This is a simple(ish) program that can list the contents of any directory but the default is "/usr/bin."
The toybox command is not new, it is an android command that I like very much so I made a version for the Raspberry Pi and other Linux systems.
To install it just open terminal and type "chmod +x toybox && sudo mv toybox /usr/bin" and you are done.
For some info on how to use toybox and it's features try "toybox -help" or "./toybox -help" if you have not installed it yet, "-h" works too if you are lazy >:)
